#Smart Components 
All your code logic needs to be handled here.
They are also called containers.
They interact with the store(aka state management) to update your components.

#Dumb Components
They just read props from your containers and render you components.
This is just the UI view and should not contain any logic.
All styling/html/css comes in your dumb components.
